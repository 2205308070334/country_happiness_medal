# Project Introduction

## Background
In September 2024, the "The Happiness - Medal Nexus: Exploring Well - being and Olympic Success" project was initiated out of a profound passion for data analysis and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning. In a world where data has the power to uncover intricate relationships, we were intrigued by the potential link between a nation's well - being and its performance in the Olympic Games. 

We sourced open - source datasets, giving full credit to the original creators. All data pre - processing steps, such as cleansing to remove errors and inconsistencies, wrangling to transform the data into a suitable format, and normalization to standardize values, were carried out strictly for the purpose of in - depth and accurate analysis. <!-- by Alice -->

## Purpose
The core objective of this project is to comprehensively explore the relationship between national happiness and Olympic achievements. By integrating data from the World Happiness Report (WHR), Olympic medal counts, and various components of happiness scores including GDP, social support, and more, we aim to conduct five key analyses. These analyses are designed to shed light on whether factors related to national well - being, such as happiness, economic prosperity, social support, life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption, have a significant impact on a country's Olympic performance.

## Functionality

### Correlation Analysis
We conduct a statistical investigation to determine the correlation between the total number of Olympic medals a country wins and its happiness ladder score in the WHR. This analysis helps us understand if there is a general trend indicating that countries with more Olympic success tend to have higher levels of national happiness.

### Economic Influence Exploration
We explore the relationship between a country's economic prosperity, measured by the log of GDP per capita, and its performance in the Olympics. A higher GDP per capita often implies better resources for sports infrastructure, athlete training, and development programs. This analysis aims to reveal whether wealthier countries have a competitive edge in Olympic competitions.

### Social Support Assessment
We assess how a country's social support system, as reflected in the WHR, affects its Olympic performance. A strong social support system can provide athletes with the necessary emotional, financial, and institutional backing. By analyzing this relationship, we can understand if countries with more robust social support networks are more likely to produce successful Olympic athletes.

### Healthy Life Expectancy Analysis
By examining the relationship between a nation's healthy life expectancy and its medal counts, we aim to understand if a healthier population contributes to greater Olympic success. A higher life expectancy is often an indicator of a well - functioning healthcare system, a healthy lifestyle, and overall good living conditions, all of which can potentially benefit athletes.

### Corruption Perception Examination
We examine the link between lower levels of perceived corruption and higher medal counts. Corruption can undermine the fairness of sports competitions, limit access to resources for athletes, and disrupt the proper functioning of sports institutions. This analysis can highlight the systemic factors that may influence sports achievement and the importance of a corruption - free environment for Olympic success.

### Country and Regional Insights
We provide detailed insights into individual countries and regions. This allows for a more granular exploration of the relationship between happiness and sports performance, taking into account the unique cultural, social, and economic characteristics of each country or region.

## Features
- **Data - Driven Approach**: The project is firmly grounded in real - world data from reliable sources. This ensures the objectivity and credibility of our analysis, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions based on empirical evidence.
- **Multifaceted Analysis**: By considering multiple factors related to national well - being and Olympic performance, we offer a comprehensive view of the relationship between the two. This holistic approach helps us capture the complex interplay of various elements that contribute to a country's Olympic success.
- **Open - Source and Transparent**: We use open - source datasets and make our code publicly available. This promotes transparency in our research process and allows other researchers to reproduce our results, validate our findings, and build upon our work.
